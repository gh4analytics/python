    "## Business Case\n",
    "Our client is a Real Estate Investment Agent (REIA) who is doing business within a small county in New York state. They invest in houses, apartments and condos by buying properties from people and selling it back to their customers. As part of their business, they wanted to predict the fair price of a property before it is sold. This is to caliberate their internal pricing models and keep a pulse on the market. "

    "1. Unfortunately, the skill levels of appraisers vry greatly.\n",
    "2. During a trial run,REIA compared appraiser estimates to actual prices.\n",
    "3. It was identified that estimates given by inexperienced appraisers were off by $70,000 on average\n"
