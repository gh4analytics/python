    "## Business Case\n",
    "A Real Estate Investment Agent (REIA) who is doing business within a small county in New York by buying properties from people and selling it back to their customers. They invest in houses, apartments and condos.  As part of the business, they wanted to predict the fair price of a property before it is sold. This is to caliberate their internal pricing models and keep a pulse on the market. "
